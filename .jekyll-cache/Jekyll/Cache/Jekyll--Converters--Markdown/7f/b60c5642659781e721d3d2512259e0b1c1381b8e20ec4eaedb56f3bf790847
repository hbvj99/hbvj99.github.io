<p><i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> I studied Computing and graduted in 2019 from London Met. I wouldn’t say I spend most of time learing new tech but rather learn-through-experience or fantasizing the next big discovery - it didn’t happen of course.</p>

<p><i class="fas fa-book"></i> In this blog, I try to visualize some of my work/learnings that intrest me, the topic includes software development &#38; guides, research or I occasionally share my stories.</p>
