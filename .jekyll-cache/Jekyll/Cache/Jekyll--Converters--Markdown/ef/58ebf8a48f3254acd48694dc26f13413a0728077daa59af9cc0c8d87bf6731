I"ý<h1 id="hello">Hello,</h1>
<p>Iâ€™m Vijay Pathak - interested in Software Development, Data Science.</p>

<p><i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> I studied Computing and graduted in 2019 from London Met, I wouldnâ€™t say I spend most of time learing new tech but rather learn-through-experience or fantasizing the next big discovery - it didnâ€™t happen of course.</p>

<p><i class="fas fa-book"></i>
 In this blog, I try to visualize some of my work/learnings that intrigue me, the topic includes software engineering &#38; guides, research or I occasionally share my stories.</p>

<p><i class="fas fa-heart"></i> I believe in open source solutions and digital literacy.</p>
