# Hello,
<br>
Iâ€™m Vijay Pathak - interested in automation, data science and cybersecurity.

## Background

I graduated with honours in Computing from London Met in 2019, I wouldn't say I spend most of time learing new tech but rather learn-through-experience or fantasizing the next big discovery - it didn't happen of course.  

In this blog, I try to visualize some of my work/learnings that intrigue me, the topic includes software engineering &#38; guides, research or I occasionally share my stories. I believe in open source solutions and digital literacy.

If you would like to connect, you can follow me on social media or simply drop an <a href="mailto:vijay@vijaypathak.com.np" target="_blank">email</a>.
