## Hello,
<i class="fas fa-code"></i> Iâ€™m Vijay Pathak - interested in automation, data science and software development.

<i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> I studied Computing and graduted in 2019 from London Met, I wouldn't say I spend most of time learing new tech but rather learn-through-experience or fantasizing the next big discovery - it didn't happen of course.

<i class="fas fa-book"></i>
 In this blog, I try to visualize some of my work/learnings that intrigue me, the topic includes software engineering &#38; guides, research or I occasionally share my stories.

<i class="fas fa-heart"></i> I believe in open source solutions and digital literacy.

<i class="fas fa-envelope"></i> If you would like to connect, you can follow me on social media or simply drop an <a href="mailto:vijay@vijaypathak.com.np" target="_blank">email</a>.
