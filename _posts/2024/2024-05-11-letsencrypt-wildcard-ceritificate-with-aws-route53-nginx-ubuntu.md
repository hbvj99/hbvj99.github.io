Any website requires automated wildcard certificate renewal to provide uninterrupted secure connectivity without human intervention or downtime.

I'm sure most of you are familiar with Letâ€™s Encrypt certificates, when you have multiple domains like `somedomain.com`, `two.somedomain.com`, we usually create certificates for each. For multiple sub-domains, wildcard certificates offer greater flexibility by automatically securing any new subdomains created under the main domain without needing additional certificates or configuration changes. It supports infinite sub-domains like `*.somedomain.com`.

## Issue

In Let's Encrypt, a wildcard certificate is supported but can be created using manual command using ACMEv2 certbot [DNS-01 challenge](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge), it will ask to post some random record in your DNS, in wildcard certificates real-time generation process you have to add the TXT record to verify ownership. The major cons of using this method is it doesn't support automated certificate renewal by default - when it expires in 90 days you have to generate a new certificate by using the same command and add a new record again. The manual command to get a wildcard certificate using Nginx is;
- `sudo certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges=dns --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory -d somedomain.com -d *.somedomain.com`.

## Solution

Fortunately, major domain providers have plugins that can offer an automated way to verify ownership using [DNS plugins](https://eff-certbot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using.html#dns-plugins) and [dns-01](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-8.4). We'll be using `certbot-dns-route53` package to renew SSL in AWS automatically.

Let's learn the process of configuring and installing certbot.

## Configuration

### Ububtu Server
[Certbot EEF](https://certbot.eff.org/) website has a guide to installing cerbot on different operating systems, we'll consider [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/server), [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) on the guide.

1. Install the classic certbot package with `sudo snap install --classic certbot`.
2. Make certbot command executable using `sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot`.
3. Confirm containment level using `sudo snap set certbot trust-plugin-with-root=ok`, it is required for wildcard domains.
4. Install the AWS Route53 plugin using `sudo snap install certbot-dns-route53`.

### AWS Account

Make sure you have a domain in AWS hosted zone. We will configure plugins to access the domain records and change them dynamically.

1. Get the Domain-hosted zone ID.
2. Create this policy inside `IAM` and replace `YOUR_HOSTED_ZONE_ID` with your ID.

### Policy 1

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "certbot-dns-route53 sample policy",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "route53:ListHostedZones",
                "route53:GetChange"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect" : "Allow",
            "Action" : [
                "route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets"
            ],
            "Resource" : [
                "arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/YOUR_HOSTED_ZONE_ID"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Policy 2

Alternatively, you can use this for granting access to all of your hosted zone domains. The above [Policy 1](#policy-1) is preferred.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "route53:ListHostedZones",
                "route53:GetChange",
                "route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

3. Next, Create a new User in `IAM` and attach the newly created AWS Policy to this user.
4. Finally create an access key for the user - choose CLI as the use case and note `Access Key`, `Secret Access Key`.
5. In the Ubuntu server root directory, create directory `.aws` and `config` files.
6. Paste the AWS secrets in the file `~/.aws/config` as;

```bash
[default]
aws_access_key_id=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key=YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```



## Generate Certificate
1. Run the command to get a wildcard certificate using `sudo certbot certonly --dns-route53 -d somedomain.com -d *.somedomain.com`.
2. Command to renew certificate is `sudo certbot renew --dns-route53`.

## Auto-renew certificates
The next step is to make sure it renews automatically. We will create a cron jon to check and renew the certificate when required. A custom crontab is essential as the default certbot `sudo certbot renew` will not work with custom plugins.

Open Linux crontab using;
- `crontab -e` and paste the code at the last line.
- `0 23 * * * sudo certbot renew --dns-route53 >> /home/ubuntu/logs/cron_job.log 2>&1`.
- Above cron will run every day at 23:00 and log the output to the `/home/ubuntu/logs/cron_job.log` directory. Make sure the file exists in the directory.
